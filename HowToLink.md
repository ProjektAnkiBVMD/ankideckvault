=> For Larger Files on Google Drive
(Google uses on larger files a authentication (i believe the size this happens is around 500mb~)
=> For this Step its important that you are logged into your gmail account and then follow the next steps!
- you need to do two extra Steps:
  1. Open your Shared Link, like you normally would

  3. Now you just need to copy the link above into the addon window
     (the link should look something like this: https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=(thefileid)&export=download&authuser=0)

If you do not own a Google-Account and you link looks like this: 
**https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=(thefileid)&export=download**
=> Please add to your Link "&authuser=0" => This step is quite important for the DeckVault Link Encryption/Decryption
